/**

 *  content *through the window* (unlike a SurfaceView, which is a separate
 *  full-opacity SurfaceFlinger layer), so the window's sub-cap alpha dims it and
 *  Android 12+'s obscured-touch rule lets taps fall through to the app below —
 *  validated on device. The [ScreenCaptureGlWorker] owns all GL: it creates an
 *  EGL window surface from this view's SurfaceTexture and presents the overlay
 *  straight into it. This view only forwards the SurfaceTexture's lifecycle.
