/** Single-call JNI fast-path for the live-camera planar OCR pipeline.
 *
 *  Per-frame entry point: [processFrameGl] borrows the camera's
 *  `GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES`, GPU-renders canonical luma into a small
 *  `Vec<u8>` to feed the tracker, then presents the camera + overlay
 *  composite straight to the bound EGL surface via the native
 *  `GlesRenderer` — all in one JNI call. Acquire/refresh frames read
 *  full-res RGBA back from the same texture inside the call.
 *
 *  Returns a packed `Long` so Kotlin doesn't need a follow-up uniffi
 *  call for the debug-pill update. Detailed async-job telemetry (rec
 *  counts, ms, cancel) is *not* packed in — poll
 *  `LivePlanarTracker.lastAcquireTelemetry()` to refresh the pill.
